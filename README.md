# CS767: Big Data and Data Mining Assignment 1

## Deliverables

- You will set up a Web page that provides links to HTML data and the two tables. HTML data of each Web site must be 
listed within a directory for that website. So if you set up your team's page on Google Sites, you may still need to 
find a place somewhere else to store HTML data.
- The two tables are stored in two files named tableA.csv and tableB.csv
